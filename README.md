This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type mismatch error. The function `printAllNumbers` is designed to accept an array of numbers and print each number to the console. However, if you try to pass an array containing both numbers and strings, you'll get a type error. This is because TypeScript's type system enforces strict type checking, preventing you from passing a value of a different type than what the function expects. The solution demonstrates how to handle such situations, by either changing the function type or filtering the array before processing it.
